<h3>Euclidean Rhythm Music Sequencer Using Actors in Python</h3>

<h3>Daniel P. Prince</h3>

<b>Abstract</b>
</center>
<blockquote>
A real-time sequencer that implements the Euclidean rhythm algorithm is created for creative generation of drum sequences by musicians or producers. Modern synchronization techniques using the Actor model are used to simplify the communication required for interactivity and musical timing. Other techniques such as generators and higher order functions are also used to simplify the program. The resulting application sends Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) data interactively to another application for sound generation.
