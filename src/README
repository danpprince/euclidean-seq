Application created using Python 2.7.11 on OS X 10.11.3

The Python module dependencies are described in requirements.txt and may be

Also note that this application does not generate sound on its own, but rather
generates MIDI information to be used as the input to another application. An
intermediate MIDI routing application is required, as well as a destination 
application that accepts MIDI notes and triggers samples or synthesizers. Without 
these accompanying MIDI applications, no actual drum sounds will be created.
